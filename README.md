# TENGU-Blockchain-Explorer
Block explorer for Tengu CryptoNote based cryptocurrency.

All Credits & Thanks go to TurtleCoin Developers for getting me this far.

#### Installation

1) It takes data from daemon tengud. It should be accessible from the Internet. Run tengud with open port as follows:
```bash
./tengud --enable-cors="*" --enable_blockexplorer --rpc-bind-ip=0.0.0.0 --rpc-bind-port=11898

```
2) Just upload to your website and change 'api' variable in config.js to point to your daemon.
